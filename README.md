# Course Description
This course provides an in-depth coverage of various topics in big data from data generation, storage,
management, transfer, to analytics, with focus on the state-of-the-art technologies, tools, architectures,
and systems that constitute big-data computing solutions in high-performance networks. Real-life bigdata
applications and workflows in various domains (particularly in the sciences) are introduced as use
cases to illustrate the development, deployment, and execution of a wide spectrum of emerging big-data
solutions.

# Final Project
Develop an Oozie workflow to process and analyze a large volume of flight data.
1. Form a project team of two students (including yourself).
2. Install Hadoop/Oozie on your AWS VMs.
3. Download the Airline On-time Performance data set (flight data set) from the period of October 1987 to April 2008 on the Statistical Computing website: http://statcomputing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html
4. Design, implement, and run an Oozie workflow to find out
    a. the 3 airlines with the highest and lowest probability, respectively, for being on schedule;
    b. the 3 airports with the longest and shortest average taxi time per flight (both in and out), respectively; and
    c. the most common reason for flight cancellations.
